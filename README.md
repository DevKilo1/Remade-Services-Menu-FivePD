# Remade Services Menu FivePD
 
**DESCRIPTION**

This menu aims to be a separate services menu that can provide **RELIABLE** services with the grand possibility of **INTERACTIVE** services in the future. It also cleans up after itself, unlike the normal FivePD services. We don't use the FiveM natives, this is custom-coded from the ground up. It also offers **BACKSPACE** from LSPDFR if they get stuck!

**INSTALLTION**

Drag and drop the .DLL file into your fivepd/plugins folder!
